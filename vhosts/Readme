It's a note from myself to explain what containers we have.
some of our containers were in a docker network named "mytestnet" and their docker-compose were something like this:


version: "3.7"

services:
  tokenskidoo:
    build: .
    image: tokenskidoo-app
    container_name: tokenskidoo-app
    restart: always
    networks:
      - mytestnet

networks:
  mytestnet:
    external: true
    
    
    
and because of that, here in the conf file, we wrote their container name as for exmaple "tokenskidoo-app"  and the port which is written in it's Dockerfile 
which was something like this:

FROM node:16.14.2

# install simple http server for serving static content
# RUN npm install -g http-server

# make the 'app' folder the current working directory
WORKDIR /app

# copy both 'package.json' and 'package-lock.json' (if available)
COPY package*.json ./

# install project dependencies
RUN npm install

# copy project files and folders to the current working directory (i.e. 'app' folder)
COPY . .

# build app for production with minification
RUN npm run build

# EXPOSE 8080
# CMD [ "http-server", "dist" ]
EXPOSE 3009

ENV NUXT_HOST=0.0.0.0
ENV NUXT_PORT=3009

CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]




so finally the ip and port will be something like this :     http://tokenskidoo-app:3009
